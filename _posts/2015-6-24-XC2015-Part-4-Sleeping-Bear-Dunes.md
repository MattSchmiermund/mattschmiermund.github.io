So, Meghan's last day of school was back on the 19th, but in exchange for several weeks of dog sitting for our two dogs, we agreed to watch all three of the beasts while my parents were at a wedding on the 26th.  In the meantime, we figured we could make the most of being in Michigan and still started our trip right away.  Part of that was the previous post on Cedar Part, and the next step was dipping our toes into camping for a single night before heading out on our \'big\' trip.

I started thinking about what was in Michigan that I hadn't been to or seen.  I rmemebered some kid\'s presentation on Sleeping Bear Dunes back in fifth grade.  I assumed it was a state park, but once I started looking into it, I found that it was a National Lakeshore, which was perfect.  We were planning to buy our _America the Beautiful_ pass and being able to use that was going to save us some money.  

We headed up late morning on Tuesday.  We drove North on 127, and while I knew there were a good number of wind turbines over in the thumb of Michigan, I was shocked at the number we encountered up around Clare.

In general we didn't do much in the way of research for this trip, so we headed into the visitor center in Empire.  We bought our season pass for the parks and got our first _Passport To Your National Parks_ stampbook.  The first campgrounds we had encountered before the visitor center were closed for maintenance and the rangers at the visitor center directed us further north to the D.H. Day Campground.  We got there around 4:00 and they were a bit over half full, but will still had plenty of sites to choose from.  Meghan had never setup my tent and I hadn't in a couple of years.  She did just fine, we didn't have an communication issues, but I confused myself and screwed up several times.

We needed to find a grocery store to get some dinner, headed over and did the scenic drive, and then walked to Lake Michigan before we cooked.  We settled on soup and some veggie sticks for an easy to prep and clean meal.  (Plus a Bota Brick, but ...whatever.)  The scenic drive had a cool spot or two, but several of the pulloffs they had established in the guidebook were lame.

It\'s been a long time since I\'ve been in a Great Lake, and I couldn\'t resist wading in.  It was cold.  Very cold.  Standing there got me to thinking about the fact that it's been nine and a half years since I moved to the East Coast.  After finding out I'm from the midwest, I've had multiple people on the East Coast make comments to me about how I must be blown away by the ocean.  I've always just kind of shrugged my shoulders and said yeah, we had the Great Lakes.  They've laughed and kind of scoffed at the comparison.  I mean the ocean is soooo much bigger.  Yeah, it is.  Clearly.  But when you're standing there and you can't see land in any direction, it feels the same.  But it's fresh water and there aren't sharks, hurricanes, or man-eating squid.

We headed back, heated our soup over the backpacking stove and we were in our sleeping bags before dark.  There was a YMCA group with a bunch of teenage girls a few sites down.  They were incredibly obnoxious in the evening.  I imagine it was a challenging group to wrangle, but I got the sense their adults had given up.  Thankfully, once quiet hours hit, they settled down.  I didn't check what Meghan had brought with us for this little part of our trip and she was lacking colder weather attire.  Temps dropped to the low 50s.  I'm a nice person, so she got my fleece.  We have some extra blankets packed and in general we were pretty OK.  Meghan recalls sleeping in a tent only twice before, but I've told her they don\'t count because she was on a cot for one of them and the other was a platform tent.  

We got up at a decent time on Wednesday, got ourselves packed up.  We headed over to the well marked Dune Climb area, where they prefer people try to climb the dunes.  Once we got to the top of climb you can see from the road, we had assumed we would have had a view of the lake.  Nope.  We continued a on flat section for quite a ways, and assumed the climb we saw in the distance would provide a view, so we kept trucking.  Got to the top of that climb, and... nope.  There was a bit of a descent and another smaller climb up.  We gave that a go.  At the top of that smaller climb, we found a sign that said we were 1.3 hilly miles from the lake.  We could see where the marked trail dropped down and to the left, but if we stayed high and right it looked like we might get view in only a couple of hundred more yards.  We went and we finally got our view.  The lake wasn't amazing, but the scenery of what was between us and the lake very much was.

Walking uphill on sand, much like pimping, ain\'t easy.  

General thoughts:
   -We used an atlas to find our way up there.  It was such a strange and novel experience we decided we are running no-nav for the whole trip.  #RoadTripHipsters
   -I'm not a big fan of shoes and I will be avoiding them for as much of this trip as possible.  Pointy rocks and all.  #GetAJobYouFilthyBaldHeadedHippy
