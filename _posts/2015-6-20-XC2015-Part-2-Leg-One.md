Meghan/'s last day at school was the 19th.  We ran around a bunch on Friday trying to get the house put back together (we have a small renovation in progress), kitchen cleaned so we can come back to a somewhat clean house, not to mention getting us packed.  We both crashed sooner than we had wanted, which left more to do on Saturday morning than planned.  But we had made dinner plans in Cleveland, so we knew we needed to be on the road by 8:00.  We managed to get out the door just 15 minutes late, which I was pretty pleased with.

We knew fitting the dogs and all of our gear was going to be a tight fit so, we had sent some of the bulkier things like our tent, and camp chairs ahead to Michigan a few weeks back.  Plus, we planned to a borrow a cooler and a larger camp stove to compliment my smaller MSR Wisperlight backpacking stove.  That much less we had to worry about while we had to transport the dogs. 

We filled up at our local gas station and for the purposes of the fuel reports (yeah, I'm going to post fuel reports) we wanted to start with a full tank of gas.

We ended up getting to Cleveland about 10 minutes early and enjoyed a nice dinner with Aunt Betty and Uncle Bob, and Aunt Elaine.  We hadn't seen any of them in too long and it was nice to catch up. 

We got into my parents house shortly after 11.  My brother had come over for the night so we could all spend Father\'s day together (well, _all_ except for Kelly of course.).  We had a couple of drinks and I thought I was heading to bed, but Mike wanted to introduce me to a British tv show _The Inbetweeners_.  We ended up watching three episodes and if I hadn't been so tired, I would have stayed for more.  After the few days I had leading up to leaving home, I shouldn't have been up to 3AM, but whatever.  No Ragrats.  (Not even one letter.)

On Father's Day we drug our Dad to a movie that he was only mildly interested in seeing - _Inside Out_.  We are in general fans of Pixar movies (especially Meghan) and parts of it were a bit drawn out with flashy colors to appeal to the kids, but I think was very deserving of its 98% Rotten Tomatoes rating.

Back home for some cornhole, grilling, (probably a beer or two), plus educating the dogs on how to properly exit the pool without damaging the liner, and then to top off the day, we watched my parents batshit crazy neighboor set off fireworks within feet of his back door.  The best part of it... the wind resulted in them going off directly over my parent\'s roof.
