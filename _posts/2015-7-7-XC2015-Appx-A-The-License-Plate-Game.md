We are now up to 48/51 license plates and Meghan has gotten pretty serious about it.

Dos and Don\'ts of the License Plate Game:

  - Do not talk about the License Plate Game
  - Do not talk about the License Plate Game
  - Do go the long way out of the parking lot to maximize LP exposure
  - Do not unnecessarily go into a parking lot just for the sake of seeing more LPs - that\'s just taking it too far
  - Do mock the progress of random children you encounter in the parking lot who are also playing the LP game (Meghan\'s rule, not mine)

So there we are at one of the parking lots in Mesa Verde and after hearing a small child say to his Mom \"Look. New Hampshire! We have to write that down.\", Meghan struck up a conversation with the child.  

Here is where our stories diverge.

**Following conversation takes place with Meghan while she drives:**

_So then what happened?_

I heard him say that and so I said to him, \"We\'ve got 44. How many are you up to?\"

_So then how did he react to your question?_

He said, \"We\'ve got 33.\", and the Mom said \"Do you have Hawaii yet?\"

_Did it seem like a friendly interaction?_

Hahaha, YES!

**Apparently, I witnessed something entirely different.  Here is my story:**

Upon hearing this young wannabe openly talk about the License Plate game, Meghan scoffs and flashes me an over the top look of disgust.  I see the lightbulb click in her head.  Oh god, she\'s engaging.  Meghan puts her typical smile back on and with with just the slightest hint of condescention says to the kid \"We\'ve got 44.  How many are _you_ up to?\"

Burn.

The gauntlet has been thrown down.  

The look of smug satisfaction on Meghan\'s face was disturbing enough, but what was even more upsetting was how it seemed to grow more joyfull as we watched the young man physically slump and mutter \"We only have 33.\"

The boy\'s mom, jumping to her son\'s defense, trembled out \"Well, yeah but do you have Hawaii.\"  She tried to fight, but you could tell her spirit was crushed.  

Meghan\'s eyes narrowed and she locked in on the gaze of the already defeated mother.  "No not yet, but you can bet we will before your sorry asses ever see a Rhode Island.\"  Fatal blow.  She had been bested.  Meghan giggled a little and said \"I think she might actually cry.\"

As the broken family limped off to tend to their wounds, Meghan quickly glanced over and whispered \"Bitches gotst to learn.\"

Seriously guys, do not talk about the License Plate Game.

**So\.\.\.**

Whose story is true?  I guess we\'ll never know.
