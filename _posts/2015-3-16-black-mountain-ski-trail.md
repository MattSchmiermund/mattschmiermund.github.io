Location : Jackson, NH<br/>
Vertical Drop : 1200 ft<br/>
Ascent Time : Too embarrassed to say<br/>
Descent Time : A Few Minutes<br/>

**Background:**   
The Black Mountain Ski Trail was cut in the early 1930s by the CCC.  The Black Mountain Ski Area is on the south face of the mountain, while the trail in question is on the west.  The ski trail does not reach the summit and the trail and ski area have a fair distance between them.

**My Trip:**   
With cold overnight temperatures (leading to crusty snow in the AM), a relatively short hike, and daylight well after 6PM, I figured a later start would work in my favor.  Skinning up was very easy, but I was definitely moving slow.  Somewhere around the half-way point, I saw another skier heading in my direction.  I stepped off the side of the trail to give him plenty of room.  We made some small talk, and that was the only person I ran into.

Based on it\'s pitch alone, I would expect it to be a green at most resorts.  However, it is ungroomed and fairly narrow at points, adding to its difficulty.

**Equipment:**  
My altimeter was never really acting right.  It showed me climbing 100 vertical feet after what I would have guessed to be 200-300.  Sometimes it\'s slow to update, but never that far off. The next time I looked down, it had jumped up nearly 4000 ft to 5092 and then just stayed there.  Despite the elevation drop on the drive home.\.\. still 5092.  I\'m going to recalibrate it and give it another try the next time I\'m at a ski area, but I\'m guessing it\'s done and I\'m going to need to send an email or two.  It\'s a couple of years old and out of warranty, but hopefully, High Gear will be willing to replace it.  

I could have pulled out a lighter pair of boots and swapped to appropriate cartridges on my bindings, but I didn\'t think about it until I was on the trail.  

My emergency beacon worked well.  Sent messages quickly and reliably.  Unfortunately, the OK-messages were only going to me and not my wife.  That\'s a mistake on my part and the SOS message would have still worked correctly, but clearly I need to double-check these things.
