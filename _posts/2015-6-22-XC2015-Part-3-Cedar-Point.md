At some point back in the day we lived 15-20 minutes away from \"America's Rockin\' Rollin\' Coast\".  Season passes were in our stockings for each Christmas.  The first year there was the Summer after sixth grade.  At that point, the main draw of the park was getting over my fear the coasters and exjoying the addrenalin of those initial drops.  By our last year there, the summer after eighth grade, my main motivation for going was enjoying some relatively new freedom with friends.  We spent most of our time walking around and making embarassing attempts at talking to girls.  

I have pretty fond memories of the place. 

After we moved back up to the mitten, I think I made it back there no more than 3-4 times, but I haven\'t back since 2000 (I think?).  It was one of the things I was interested in doing while we were in the mid-west.  Meghan hadn't been, but was interested, so we decided on Monday, figuring that would be the least crowded of the days we had available.  Plus, there were threats of violent storms late that afternoon.  (Scares lots of people away.)  We headed out early with the intention of being there for park open.  We ended up being about 30 minutes behind schedule, but we were close.

We headed back to the under-utilized, \'secret\' parking lot.  Got in the park and walked right on to the Magnum.  Walked on to Gemini and then headed towards the front of the park to get on the Millenium Force.  Waited no more than 20 minutes for that.  We went to ride the Mantis and found that the Mantis was no more.  It looks the track might have just been re-used with new, sit down cars instead of the Mantis\' standing gimmick.  They called it the Ragnarmarok (Not really, but something like that.)  It was pretty lame relative to the Millenium Force, but we waited less than 15 minutes.  

Lines were starting to get longer and we decided we were coastered out for a while.  They are still enjoyable, but being there is a very different experience as an adult than as a young teenager.  So we hopped on the train back in the Mean Streak area and took it for a full round trip.  During the day, we had been scoping out the food available in the various places earlier in the day and we found a burrito place that seemed like a good deal.  Slightly cheaper than the typical hot dog and fries baskets we kept running into and we got a pile of relatively healthy ingrediants.  

From there, we checked out the glass blowing demonstration, walked around the petting zoo, took Meghan\'s new glass flower out to the car, had one of the hand-tossed pretzels from Auntie Anne\'s (one of my favorite from back in the day), and then it became apparent that the storms were definitely going to hit.  We started heading to the front to see the \'Bandstand U.S.A.\' show.  It highlighted music from the 60s from various cities - New York, Philidelphia, Memphis, and Detroit.  I think it\'s the same show they've been doing for decades and I could have done without it.

The rain started pounding down on the roof while we in the show.  Thankfully, by the time it was over there was a lull and we were able to make our way towards the back.  Each time it picked up, we ducked under an awning.  Eventually employees started trying to get all of the guests fully inside and under cover.  The loud speakers started announcing tornado warnings in the area.  We were pretty close to our destination and kept pushing on when the rain slowed.  We got the Red Garter Saloon (I think?) just a bit early for the \'Rockin\' Country\' show.  I ordered an absurdly priced beer just as the show started.  The songs were a mix between old and new, the performers were generally very good (though inconsistent at times), and I enjoyed it much more than the previous show.  

By the time the show was over the rain was done we deciding that we were both pretty much done as well.  We opted for one more go on the Millenium Force before the line built up again and then we headed back to Michigan.

Some general thoughts:
-  Where the fuck did the paddle wheel boat go?  Those awful puns were a perfect way to rest for a little bit.  
-  As a kid, I enjoyed the No Fear, Big Johnson and Coed Naked shirts.  As an adult, I realize that's a fad that we collectively can do without.
-  No couples in matching outfits.  Even back then, I knew it was cringy.
-  In general, people seemed to be dressed more appropriately than they were back in the day.
-  Considerably more polite crowd than what I've seen at Six Flags NJ.  Didn't see a single instance of attemps at line cutting.  
-  My phone claims we hit 20,000 steps.  I'm not sure if it counted steps on the rides, but we did several laps around the park.
-  I'm glad we went, but I'm in no rush to go back.
