Pictures to be added later.

We got back from Sleeping Bear Dunes early evening on Wednesday.  Our plans were to head over towards Detroit to visit my brother\'s apartment in the \'burbs.  We were pretty close to the house we lived in during the early 90s, so we headed over to visit our old neighboorhood.  Meghan was bored out of our mind as we talked about who used to live where, but she was a trooper and only made one sarcastic comment.  

Thursday morning was really the only time we had set aside for some prep shopping trips.  We headed over to the Northville REI to get a piece of gear or two and a handful of dehydrated camping meals.  Between bike and camping related interests, t,hat store laid claim to most of the money I made in the \'99 to \'03 range.  The back to B-town for a good ol\' Meijer trip.  We loaded up on dry goods for some planned meals, cans of soup, various liquids, and some junk food. 

Thursday evening was a bit more exciting.  My brother was back to spend the night before taking off on Friday and we had some old friends coming down to stay at my parents place.  Keeping with what I think might still be protocol for personal blogs they will referred to as AFR.  There was a simple grilled meal, some drinking, some cornhole and then we settled in for some bullshiting, Bananagrams, drinking, and movies.  Along the way Mike shared his thoughts on the state of various tech companies, discussed the comedy writing careers of various cast members of _Wet Hot American Summer_, and perhaps most importantly, enlightened us on just how terrifying a goat with the speed of a squirrel would be.  (At least ten times scarier.)  He made some good points and I think we all had a good night.

Friday included a good breakfast I don't even remember, walking the dogs out on the horse trails of Kensington Metro Park, more grocery shopping, an amazing meatball meal prepared by the A of AFR, boardgames, watching a variety of humorous youtube videos.  I stayed up too late and \"didn't drink enough water\", which screwed with our plans for leaving the next day, but it was good to catch up.

On Saturday, after another great breakfast, we began preparing to leave and it quickly became apparent it just really wasn't going to happen.  The car needed to be emptied and repacked, I underestimated how much stuff in the house still needed to be organized and put together, plus I was trying to borrow various equipment from my Dad that I needed to learn how to use.  Instead, we settled on an early dinner, an early bedtime, and decided to leave in a more relaxed way on Sunday.

For a third day in a row, we had a very good breakfast, and then left Michigan at 12:30 and after a few driver switches and two stints in rest areas, we hit the Badlands National Park 21 and a half hours later.  Campsite claimed before 9AM their time, and now we are just finishing some food in a diner next to the primary visitor center.

The only excitment with the drive was hitting something (maybe a plastic bucket) somewhere in Minnesota.  We pulled over and the only thing we could see leaking just appeared to be condensation from the AC.  Gas mileage was absolutely terrible.  The 80 mph speed limits in South Dakota didn't help anything.  Hopefully as we hit parks and hillier areas we'll see better numbers.  

General thoughts:

* As we hit the border of Minnesota, Meghan pointed at a body of water and asked if what I knew what it was.  \"Oh, that\'s lake 8,762 of 10,000\".  Later on this morning it occurred to us that it was the Mississippi.  I was promptly informed of how much of a jackass I am.  Fair enough.
* We've already checked off 41/51 license plates. (DC counts.  I mean, not in Congress, but for our purposes.)  Meghan has no faith in finding Alaska or Hawaii.  Time _will_ prove her wrong.
* We're already around too many people.
