title : The Badlands, Poor Planning and Delightfully Bad Decisions
layout : post
---

After our nearly straight through drive and laying claim to a campsite so early we (or at least I) had a sense of having all the time in the world.  After breakfast we doubled back to where we entered the park and stopped at some of the scenic points where it seems to be OK-ish to walk around on the buttes (or spires?  I don't know, I\'m not a rock-doctor).  Stopped frequently as we drove through the Badlands Scenic Loop and then started heading west.  The plan was to do a drive by of Mount Rushmore (even with a NP pass, the parking lot was built and is maintained by an independant third party, so they charge for parking...), and then head a bit further south to Wind Cave NP.  We figured something like an hour to get there.  Unfortunately, it was closer to two.  

By the time we drove through the tourist hell-hole that is the area surrounding Rushmore, navigated the twisty roads to the visitor center at Wind Cave and ran through the downpour, it was well after 4:00.  With the various cave tours all running in the vicinity of an hour and a half, we decided there was no way we could do that and still catch the sunset around our campsite.  So we decided we would come back through on Tuesday and started to head home.  At this point, Meghan was driving, I was checking out the map and I asked if she was up for an adventure.  In the spirit of the trip, I got back a half enthusiastic, half uneasy, "sure!?"

Instead of heading north to I-90 or local highway 44, I directed her through the tiny town of Buffalo Gap, past \"The Last Chance Saloon\" (apparently an established bar in someone's garage - I wonder if their open if it\s raining and they have to close the overhead garage door), and onto a road labeled \"2\".  It was dirt and 30 miles long. It would have taken us straight accross to the Badlands, and it very nearly did.  As we hit the edge of the reservation land, there was a road closed sign.  We decided to ignore clearly defined signs, ignore the logical decision making process, and drove around.

The road deteroriated a bit from there.  Nothing bad, still very driveable, even for our little guy Prius C.  The pastures got hillier, we could start to see the badlands in the distance, the Black Hills were over our left shoulder, we past a sign that indicated cattle were \'at large\', drove over a cattle control grate, and the all fencing disappeared.  We stopped to take some pictures of a small herd of mule deer.  The whole thing is beautiful, and to top it off, it\'s a shortcut, we\'re saving time.  We might be the smartest people ever.

You, being smarter than me, already know where this is heading.

The Prius isn\'t orange, will never sport a confederate flag, and I don\'t even know anyone named Bo or Duke. So... while I appreciated Meghan\'s suggestion of jumping it, I just didn\'t think it was going to happen.  

Fuck.

We did manage to get back to our campsite just before sunset.  We walked around trying to get a decent picture or two on the 35mm SLR I'm borrowing and I was hopefully successful.  But... I forgot that you have to pay attention to how many pictures are left and I was busy changing film for the shots I actually wanted.  I'm interested in seeing how these pictures turn out, but sometimes new really can be better.

We heated up a pan of rehydrated sludge and for the first time in 36 hours went to sleep in a horizontal position.  

General Thoughts:

- By a variety of measures, the day was something of a failure, but I think we enjoyed our little side adventure and I\'m sure it\'s not our last \'clusterwhoops\' of a day.
- Badlands Campground guests were way way way more quiet than what we experienced at Sleeping Bear Dunes.  It seemed like families were still having fun, but no youth groups and no kids felt the need to screech at the top of their lungs while riding bikes.
- We are insanely over packed.
- Despite being overpacked, I forgot a piece of my aero press which means no coffee and wasted space for the other parts and bean grinder.
- We have already done over 3,000 miles.
