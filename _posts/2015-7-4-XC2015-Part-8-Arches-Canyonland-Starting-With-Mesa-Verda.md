We left our Yeoman Park campsite at a decent time Wednesday morning. The car was still a damn mess, but we had taken out a minimal setuo the night before, so a full repack didn't seem very feasible.  Plus, we had a two-park day planned out.

First stop was over the boarder to the Moab, UT area.  Up into Arches, scenic drive, short short hikes, bunch of pictures, yadda yadda yadda.  We were in something of a rushed mind set and while the couple of arches were worth checking out, and \'The Wall\' was fairly impressive, we didn\'t really have a sense we were missing out on something we hadn't already seen.  

We also knew we wanted to get to Canyonlands that day.  The brochures basically tell you not to visit if you don't have a full day to dedicate to it.  The park is broken into three uniquw sections, with no pass through from one to the other.  No matter which of the two reasonable parts of the park for us to choose between, we would have a 32-24 mile trek into the visitor centers and worthwhile sets and then have to come back out the same way.  

We decided on the section of the park known as the \'The Needles\'.  As we faced the sign saying it was 32 miles in and back out, and the gas station up the road was closed, we realized we had enough gas to make it in and most of the way back out, but certainly not to the next closest gas station.  Into the next town, make the trip back... slight delay.

The temps were in the 100-105 range as we drove in towards the visitor center, and we came to a Bureau of Land Management Campground that had roofless vaulted toilettes, a ton of campsites and absolutely no one there.  The lack of water, air temperatures, and then the ground head radiating back up at you made the whole place feel a bit inhospitable.  We headed to the visitor\'s center and decided to mull over our camping options on the drive.  We found the visitor\'s center had closed thirty minutes earlier, several signs stressing the importance of consuming at least a gallon of water a day, and another sign saying all of there ranger-led programs were cancelled until the temperatures drop in the Fall.  

We still drove a ways into the park and did see some impressive looking rocks (yes, a bit sarcastic, but serious too.).  Couldn't get our NP Passport book stamped though.

We decided to skip on the free campground on the access road to The Needles.  Free would have been nice, but we still had several hours of daylight that would have been miserable heat there and wasted driving time.  

We headed back into Colorado towards Mesa Verda.  The Atlas showed a campground just north of Cahone, CO, right on the edge of the San Juan NF.  We ended up behind a Truck/RV Trailer/Boat towing combination as we passed through a BLM recreation area and into the National Forest.  He looked like he knew where he was going and we tried to follow him a bit.  Despite his three part towing setup, and us going uphill on dirt roads, we quickly lost track of him.  After a fork or two in the road, we started seeing signs for things that were 20 miles away and we knew we had passed the campground we were looking for.  

Made it back to the BLM Recreation area that we had passed earlier, and found there was a campground there.  We had been pretty happy with the half full campground the night before, but this place had two other people staying there.  Vauled toilettes, manual pump water (didn't try it, no idea if it would be considered potable or not), picnic tables and was right next to a slowly moving river.  Once again, a self pay station and a price tag of $8.

Unfortunately, our 5 gallon collapsable water jug ended up tipping over and the valve isn't quite perfect.  Some of Meghan\'s luggage ended up wet and that was the first of any of our water-based mishaps.  Soup for dinner is getting old, but it was significantly better than the dehydrated \'Breakfast Skillet\' packaged meal we had the next morning.  

We only had an hour and a half left to get to Mesa Verda we got up pretty early on Friday, so we relaxed a bit that morning.  I picked up a $4 pour-over coffee funnel to compenstate for the non-functional aeropress and made our first camp coffee of the trip.  With the feeling of having time to spare, we emptied most of the car and repacked everything.  It was badly needed and I'm sure we'll have to do it again before the trip is over. 

The following needs to be mentioned:
Meghan had done a project on Mesa Verda in the later years of elementary school.  As part of her assignment, she was supposed to create some kind of visual representation of the park.  While the rest of us would be looking to a shoebox, construction paper, and a tub of playdoh, Meghan was busy getting her 3\'x2\' sheet of plywood, chicken wire, and a bucket of spackle ready.

Anyway... when we first started talking about this trip, visiting this park was the only requirement Meghan had and we\'re planning on spending some extra time here.

By midday Friday, we had booked a campsite, gotten tickets for two of the guided tours offered, and making our way up one of the mesas.  We did the self-guided tour of the Spruce Tree House, drove the scenic loop on the Chapin Mesa and headed over to meet our guide for our Cliff Palace tour.  Both tours had a climb down into the dwelling and a climb out.  Both allowed you to walk up on appropriate parts of the ruins, and get very close, but neither put us in behind any of the walls.  Despite the numorous signs and warnings about altitude and heat, and the ladder-climbing required, we found the hikes to be quite manageable, with a variety of people all demonstrating the same. 

Had the best rehydrated package so far... Mountain House (I think?) Thai Chicken Noodles.  I wouldn't pay that to eat it at home, but judging it for what it is... not too shabby.

Our next tour was scheduled for this afternoon.  Visiting the Long House is a two hour tour and runs less often than the others.  It had a longer flat in and out hike before starting a descent with a steep stairway and then several switchbacks on an asphalt paved trail.  Touring this pueblo was a bit different as the tourguide got to go into some additional details.  She had apparently only been at the park for a few weeks, but she managed to field a continuous onslaught of questions.  In this tour we got to walk up behind some of their structures and see the spring that drained out of the back wall.

With the tour being scheduled so late and leaving us with not much for drive time, we decided to stay another night in our campsite. 

Oh... right... water-based mishap #2.  We have left the tent open a couple of times during the day to prevent heat build up at the risk of getting hit by an afternoon thunderstorm.  We had been lucky, but it wasn't going to last forever.  We emptied the tent one Packtowl's worth of water at a time.  Thankfully, it went quickly, and the fire helped dry out our sleeping pads.
