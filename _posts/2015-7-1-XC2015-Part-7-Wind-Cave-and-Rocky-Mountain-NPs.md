title : Wind Cave and Rocky Mountain NPs

On Tuesday morning we departed our Badlands campsite with hopes of hitting both Wind Cave and Rocky Mountain NPs.  We\'re were slow out of the campsite and getting to Wind Cave seemed to take even longer than the two hours I mentioned in the previous post. We wanted to do one of the guided tours and for some reason, once I found out the one that started 40 minutes later was an extra 15 minutes longer, there was no way I was going to miss out and go on the earlier one. 

The tour was pretty impressive.  Up until preparing for this trip, I wasn\'t aware of this park\'s existence.  There are over 140 miles of explored caves on multiple levels all within a square mile.  All of the different tours they offered totalled to something like 2.5 miles that the general public gets access to.  Meghan and I were both nerding out pretty hard on the presentation of the tour guide (young guy who had just graduated from college, had a great Seth Rogan laugh which added to the overall entertainment).  I\'ll resist the urge to regurgitate any additional fun facts, but will say that we both enjoyed the stop.

By the time we left there, it was pretty very clear we weren't going to make it into the Rocky Mountain NP, or any National Forest land before dark, so we started discussing our options.  Jewell Cave National Monument was on our potential list as well, but that was quickly cut.  As we hit Wyoming, driving south on I-25, we managed to thread the needle between various thunderstorms that passed either in front of or behind us.  So then we started discussing setting up the tent in the dark _and_ the rain.  I'm ashamed to say that after two nights of \'roughing it\', we tucked our tails between our legs and went and paid for a hotel room.  Spending the ~$2 on taking campground showers that morning seemed silly, but oh well, we didn't feel like being wet and cold so early in the trip. 

We headed out of our Fort Collins hotel, on Wednesday knowing only as much that we were going to go to Rocky Mountain NP.  We had planned a short nature hike, but it got cut even shorter due to the weather coming in.  To pass some time during the rain, we headed to the primary visitor center and caught a part of one of the vidoes that seem to loop in most visistor centers.  Then, on to the Trail Ridge Road.  Nicely paved road that reached a high point of 12,000'+.  We had driven the Mt. Washington auto road two years ago, and found this to be a little more intimidating.

From here is where the day wasn't really planned.  There are a ton of things we want to get to now that we are starting to head into the South West: Great Dunes, Arches, Canyonlands, 4 Corners, Mesa Verda, Bryce Canyon, Zion, Grand Canyon, Lake Mead (and The Wave), Hoover Dam (maybe? probably not, but maybe).

We were discussing this a few weeks back and had bounced around a couple of different routes and compromises, but hadn't really reached any kind of decision.  Time forced a decision and we decided to head west and cut the Great Dunes.  I\'m sure they\'re impressive, but they ae a litle bit out of the way, we've already seen dunes, and well... 

So tonight we travelled as far west on I-70 as we could, while still allowing time to find a camp site and get mostly set up with a little bit of daylight still present.  We headed south through Eagle, CO towards a state park and the White River National Forest that looked like it might have some cheap/free dispersed camping.  Signs at the entrance to Sawyer Lake SP said dispersed camping was allowed as long as you had paid for a park permit.  We drove for a good 6 miles looking for something of an established site, we may have passed a valid one very early on, but by the time we exited the state park, our NatGeo \"Adventure Atlas\" was no longer showing any roads, but we had enountered signs indicating there were a couple of campgrounds on NFS land further ahead.  The first one we hit, Yeoman Park Campgrounds, had several empty sites, vaulted toilets and an $8 price tag.  We are traveling with several gallons of water so we won\'t always need to worry about running water.  Fire ring, picnic table, decent dry kindling stashed under a pine tree, unchopped piece of dried firewood, can hear running water but not loud enough to be obnoxious.  Perfect.  

Heated up some soup, poked at the fire for a while, tried to take some film photos of a full (or nearly full) moon, other campers are extremely quiet.  We made out pretty well today.  

General Thoughts :

* Packing was slow going as we're still figuring out our \"systems\".  Given a few more nights, I think we'll be a bit more efficient 
* We\'ve seen tons of not-common-to-us wildlife in the past couple of days.  I\'ll be trying to get more pictures loaded when we have some time with an internet connection.
* I wonder if there are any of the hardcore skiers in CO still hiking and getting in some turns?  Saw several good sized patches of snow today.
* The eyes I just saw in the woods a few minutes back scared the crap out of me.  Probably just a racoon, but if I'm dead in the morning, I\'m telling you it was a bear.
