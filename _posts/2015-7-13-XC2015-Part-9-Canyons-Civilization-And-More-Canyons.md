_I've tried writing this post several times now.  It started out being dated July 6th.  I was chipping away at it, but never really catching up.  It covers a lot._  

**Sunday July 5th**

  - Early exit from Mesa Verde
  - Short drive to Grand Canyon
  - campsite claim early afternoon in a quickly filling campground
  - Spent time on the east side of the park - Desert View
  - Climbed the watchtower
  - You think you know it\'s big, but holy crap.  It\'s like big.  Really big.
  - Quick dinner
  - Ranger talk on camp cooking using a dutch oven
  - With tons of people taking pictures of sunset
  - $14 (+tax) campfire
  - Decided we were going stay a second night
  - Went to 8:30AM Ranger Talk
  - Way too many people
  - Ranger said group was probably going to go slow and might use the bus system, we bailed and walked outselves on the rim trail.
  - Covered close to three miles at a leisurely pace
  - Back to visitor center for movies/education
  - Weird NOAA-sponsered room that discussed the earth science stuff leading to the creation of the GC
   Spherical canvas screen in the middle with 4 (maybe6?) projectors all simultaneously projecting on it.  Stuff spinned around so everyone could see, or at times there were things projected on several points of the sphere.
  - Hiked about 1 mile of 600 vertical feet of the Bright Angel Trail and then headed back out.  That's not steep by my definition and it was a very smooth trail, and best of all, the temperatures were pretty reasonable. 

After the hike, we went and picked up the makings of a real food dinner.  Before we finished driving the 25 miles back to our campsite, we found outselves in the middle of yet another afternoon thunderstorm.  Instead of sitting in the parking spot of our site and waiting it out, we decided to head back out and drive around a bit.  As the storm came to end, we saw tons of people in one parking lot all taking pictures in the same direction.  DOUBLE RAINBOW ALL THE WAY ACCROSS THE SKY!  We spent a few minutes admiring how intense it was, crying, and desperately asking everyone around us what it all meant.  (For the uninitiated - check both the original and the autotuned versions on youtube.)

We had planned on getting an early start to leave the GC, but it had been a chilly night and we were both getting our best sleep as the morning sun warmed our tent up a bit.  We headed north, back up into Utah.  Capital Reef NP was just a bit too far out of the way, but we could easily fit both Bryce Canyon and Zion into our path west.  After seeing the Grand Canyon, Bryce's size was a bit underwhelming, but it's colors, vegitation, and the greater complexity in the shape of the canyon walls made for it being a worthwhile quick visit.  

Zion was just over an hour away.  Unfortunately, the late start we got in the morning led to us not getting there until after the visitor center closed.  I hadn't been too worried about it though, I mean we've seen how many rocks, canyons, various products of plate techtonics and erosion\.\.\. it was all starting to look alike.  But\.\.\. I was very wrong.  Zion was different in that we were driving on the canyon floor, looking up at the walls.  The colors, patterns in the rocks, general shape, etc was fairly unique.  I\'d certainly want to go back there, and if it meant skipping Bryce, that\'s a trade I would be willing to make. 

At the point of writing this, I don't really remember why, but I really liked the town right outside of the west side of Zion, Springdale.

At this point, we were very close to a couple of nights in a hotel and the idea of setting up the tent was so unpleasant to the both of us, we opted to just sleep in the car.  Laughlin was going to be our destination, but we weren't sure what we were going to do to kill time the next morning.  So, we drove south past Vegas, and slept in the parking lot of an outskirt casino/hotel/gas station/truck stop.  The next morning, thankfully unmurdered, we knew we were awake too early to go book a hotel room, so we headed north east up towards the Hoover Dam.  

My Momma taught me that if you don't have anything nice to say, you shouldn\'t say anything at all.  I\'m going to, once again, ignore that advice.  The Hoover Dam was lame.  I mean, yeah, I\'m sure it's considered a feat of engineering.  It generates electricity.  The story of it\'s construction is probably interesting. But I don\'t get the mass appeal of it.  It was pretty early in the day, and there were already so many people there taking crappy pictures of it\.\.\. I guess I just don\'t get it.  If we were going to spend more time there, actually go into the visitor center, take a tour, I might feel differently.  But for a quick stop like ours, it felt silly.

So\.\.\. We had been camping or car sleeping for 9 of 10 nights.  Campgrounds have ranged in amenities.  Thankfully, our Mesa Verde campgrounds had free showers nearby.  All-in-all, our camping has been going pretty smoothly, but we did promise ourselves some nights in civilization.

**Civilization**

On to Laughlin.  I ran into this idea when I was looking into whether or not Reno was a cheaper Vegas alternative.  It's considerably smaller, but there are some good size casinos and hotels with the typical restaurants and shopping.  Plus there is a large RV campground or two in the area and I was hoping that might lead to some soft poker tables. 

The Harra\'s in town had an unfortunate location, but a very affordable price. (Mid-week visit helps too.) Wi-fi was built in to the \'resort fee\' that everyone in town tacks on as an extra fee.  First afternoon there we got some laundry done, played poker, ate at Guy Fiereo\'s (or whatever it\'s spelled - My tacos were tasty, but when the hostess asked if we were fans I just stood there speechless.  Thankfully, Meghan quickly jumped in and said yes while giving me the look that means \"please just don\'t say anything.\") and played more poker.  Over two different sessions, I sat at a 3/6 Limit table for a bunch of hours, got free drinks, tipped waitresses and dealers, and shook off the cobwebs after not playing for three or so years.  In the process I was +$3.  

Day two in Laughlin - waking up in a bed was fantastic.  Due to the hot temperatures, and the walk from our hotel to the rest of the town, we went down to the river and hopped on the water taxi.  We casino hopped a little bit.  Gambled here and there.  Grabbed a drink or two. Meghan found her favorite penny slot machine, The Jade Monkey. (I was chastised for not dancing during the bonus game song.  Sorry, I guess.)  

When Meghan was developing a curriculum for her probability and statistics course, she decided she wanted to do a unit on casino games.  So, while she was seen numurous student presentations on the game of craps, she's never really seen it.  I thought she should.  She thought she shouldn\'t.  I insisted.  It was professional development. She said she would watch, but didn't want to be responsible for bets. We had some promess with the first roller, but then saw the rest of the money we put in quickly disappear after three very short lived rollers. 

We buffetted for dinner.  It was ok, not great, but acceptable.  Wine was fairly affordable and ok, not great, but acceptable.  At that point, Meghan was ready for bed, and I knew I could still get in a few hours of poker before I was going to crash.  It was Thursday night at this point, so they a couple tables dedicated to a tournament plus a 3/6L table and a 4/8L.  The 3/6 game had a number of people on the wait list, but the 4/8 game was seating immediately, so I went there.  I felt significantly more comfortable than I had the night before, there were a couple of people who came and dumped money into the table before quickly leaving, I felt like I played well, hit on a couple of draws that payed off nicely, called to showdown a couple of times with correctly placed faith on my kicker, and just at the point that was I starting to fight to keep my eyes open, I looked down and realized two things - I had turned my $100 buy-in into $385 for a +$285 night, and it was fucking time to leave.  That covered almost the entire visit to Laughlin.  

(It's now Monday as I'm writing this and four days later, I really really want to play more poker.)

Although we wanted to get the gambling, and longer relaxing stay out of the way in Laughlin, we still wanted to go to Vegas and do more of a get dinner and see a show kind of night.  So on to Vegas.

We haven't made any reservations for anything on beyond like an hour out.  While Meghan drove into town, I found Tuscaney Suites just barely off the strip.  It was significantly cheaper than anything that close and we could have booked at Bally\'s, been at the back of their hotel and had a pretty similar walk to get to Las Vegas Blvd.  We did the typical tourist thing for the afternoon.  Walked around drinking an oversize frozen drinks, oooohed and ahhhed over this and that.  We hit up one of the Tix4Tonight booths.  We were fairly underwhelmed at what was there for selection and prices, but we settled on a Cirque Du Soliel show and headed back to the hotel to get ready. 

Took the tram from Bally\'s to the MGM Grand where we started looking for a restaurant.  Along the way my attention was grabbed by a dude in a Converse chucks, blue tights, some kind of green animal print speedo (I didn\'t want to look long enough to gather details.), some kind of red robe-ish shoulder shawl kind of thing and a big puffy king\'s crown.  We made eye contact and as I nodded my head, I said \"Long live the King.\"  He broke from his conversation and with a very royal, authoritative, and mildly dismissive kind of way said \"Just keep paying your taxes, sir.\"  This might be my favorite interaction with a person, ever. 

Shortly after our brief encounter with royalty, we hopped into a Wolfgang Puck restaurant.  I don\'t know what it was called, but if I had to venture a guess, I would say - Pucky\'s?  (Or I guess he could maybe go more with the Wolf thing.  _\"Come feed the wolf_\" would make a great slogan.)  We each had a tasty speciality pizza and then crossed the street and went over to New York New York for our show.  Show was good.  Lots of talented, nimbly bimbly, flexible people. 

We looked at staying for a second night, but with the cost of our room almost doubling for a Saturday night, we decided it was time to be living cheaply again.  (There had been fight week that week, all leading up to multiple UFC titles being up for grabs on Saturday night.  Or something along those lines.)

**(Back) Into the Woods**

From vegas, we headed up towards Sequoia and Kings Canyon.  We had a first free campsite somewhere in Sequoia National Forest.  We ran into a couple of established recreation areas that had free camping, plus a couple of actual campgrounds that seemed to have slightly nicer amenities.  Unfortunately, those amenities were only slightly nicer and didn't really seem to justify the quoted $24 price tag.  We headed back towards the Isabella Lake visitor center and went across the street to the South Keysville (maybe?  Hell, who knows anymore.) recreation area.  Like the other recreation areas we had driven through, it was pretty populated, but we found that when we followed signs for the boat/raft launch (we were on the Kern River), there was another road that branched off and led to another 5-6 sites that no one was using.  (I believe this would be considered dispersed camping.  There were clearly places that were frequently used for tents, but no posts marking sites, no metal fire rings, no picnic tables, etc).  

Signs in the area made it clear that there were \"Extreme\" fire dangers, so no wood fires and no charocol fires, but gas stoves were \"OK, permit required\".  Well, we tried to stop in the visitor center and get a permit, but they weren\'t open on the weekends and we really didn\'t want to eat cold soup.  Looks like I\'m doing this without a permit. Our site was sandy, but had some browned plant life that had died off earlier in the summer.  I scraped all of that away from where the stove was going to be used and built up a rock wall as a wind block on three sides.  I have no idea if that was necessary, or helps, but I did what I could to error on the side of caution.  I just hope I didn\'t piss off Smokey.  He\'s always watching.

From there, we continued driving on some of the twistiest roads I've ever been on up into Sequoia National Park.  We did the General Sherman thing, hit up the visitor center and then headed up into the lower section of Kings Canyon NP and started scouting campgrounds.  

$18 price tag, and allowed to collect our own firewood.  We ate in the crappy park restaurant and went back and started putting the materials for our fire.  For a Sunday night, it was a pretty populated campground, and Tried our second freeze dried breakfast this morning.  Biscuits and sausage gravy.  Suprisingly delightful.

And now\.\.\. I'm finally caught up.  We just headed up to the upper part of Kings Canyon.  Hopefully we\'ll make it to Yosemite in time to find a decent campground tonight.
