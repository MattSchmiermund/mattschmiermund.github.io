Shortly after Meghan and I got married I helped someone move from Chicago to Washington State.  Along the way, we stopped at a few National Parks/Monuments/Grasslands and battlefield type places.  On my calls home, I told Meghan that the next year we should rent an RV and do a National Park tour.  That would have been the summer of 2010.  Life got busy, we didn't have the money to do it, and as a result, it just hasn\'t panned out.

We still don\'t have the money for it, but we have the time right now, so we\'re going for it.  I am unemployed again, but I have plans for taking steps towards a new career this fall.  So we kind of feel like this might be our last shot for a good number of years.

While the original idea renting an RV would have cost money, RV sites are more expensive, the gas mileage would be terrible.  The good news is, we have a Prius C and I somehow managed to convince Meghan that the best way to get comfortable with camping would be to go on a several week camping trip.  

While Meghan is typically \'a planner\', I am not.  Our compromise was her insisting I lay out a general plan, but we are intentionally not planning out all stops and when we are going to be where.  Instead we have a list of definite places we will be visiting and then a list of maybes.  To visualize everything, I put them in a custom google map.

<h4><div class="small text-center"><em>Greens are definite, yellows are maybes, oranges are less likely maybes, reds are things I looked into but ruled out for one reason or another, and the blues are cities we might be interested in visiting. </em></div></h4>

First stop will be in Michigan to visit with family and friends and drop the dogs off with their long term dog sitter.

After considering the various possibilities, we settled on starting our trip heading over to South Dakota and visiting the Badlands and the Wind Cave National Parks.  And then from there, heading down into Colorado and Utah, down into Arizona, across to Nevada and then North through California.  We haven't been sure exactly how our timing is going to work out and we've been afraid that we will be low on time as we get to Northern California.  That would mean Glacier NP would be out of the running, but as we've done our reasearch, it seems like the South West is what we really want to see.
